# Intermediate SQL - Sales Analysis

## Overview

## Business Questions
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Who are out most valuable customers? 
2. **Cohort Analysis:** How do different customer groups generate revenue?
3. **Retention Analysis:** Which customers haven't purchased recently?

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Customer Segmentation
- Categorize customers based on their total lifetime value (LTV)
- Assign customers to High, Mid and Low value groups using CASE WHEN

ðŸ“Š **Key Findings:**
- High-value segment (25% of customers) drives 66% of revenue ($135.4M)
12,372 customers (25% of 49,487 total customers)
206.4M total revenue = 66%
$10,946 is the average LTV for the high-value customer
- Mid-value segment (50% of customers) generates 32% of revenue ($66.6M)
24,743 customers (50% of 49,487 total customers)
206.4M total revenue = 32%
$2,700 is the average LTV for the mid-value customer
- Low-value segment (25% of customers) accounts for 2% of revenue ($4.3M)
12,372 customers (25% of 49,487 total customers)
206.4M total revenue = 2%
$350 is the average LTV for the low-value customer

ðŸ’¡ **Business Insights**
- High-Value (66% revenue):
    * Offer premium membership program to 12,372 VIP customers
    * Provide early access to new products and dedicated support
    * Focus on retention as losing one customer impacts revenue significantly
- Mid-Value (32% revenue):
    * Create upgrade paths for 24,743 customers through personalized promotions
    * Target with "next best product" recommendations based on high-value patterns
- Low-Value (2% revenue):
    * Design re-engagement campaigns for 12,372 customers to increase purchase frequency
    * Test price-sensitive promotions to encourage more frequent purchases
    * Focus on converting $4.3M segment to mid-value through targeted offers-


### 2. Cohort Analysis
- Tracked revenue and customer count per cohorts
- Cohorts were grouped by year of first purchase
- Analyzed customer retention at a cohort level


**ðŸ“ˆ Visualization:**

ðŸ“Š **Key Findings:**
- Revenue per customer shows a significant decreasing trend over time
    * 2022-2024 cohorts are consistently performing worse than earlier cohorts
    * Although net revenue is increasing, this is likely due to a larger customer base, which is not reflective of customer value

ðŸ’¡ **Business Insights**
- Value extracted from customers is decreasing over time and needs further investigation.
- In 2023 we saw a drop in number of customers acquired, which is concerning.
- With both lowering Lifetime Value and decreasing customer acquisition, the company is facing a potential revenue decline.


### 3. Retention Analysis
- Identified customers at risk of churning
- Analyzed last purchase patterns
- Calculated customer-specific metrics

ðŸ“Š **Key Findings:**
- Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after 2-3 years indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.
- Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systemic rather than specific to certain years.
- Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.

ðŸ’¡ **Business Insights**
- Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.
- Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.
- Predict & preempt churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.
